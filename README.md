### Hey there! 👋


I'm Victor, your friendly neighborhood data enthusiast with a law background. I'm like a computer in the sense that I approach programming challenges with a cool and calculated mindset. I'm fluent in Java, SQL, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C#, but don't worry, I won't speak in code with you.

My love for numbers and analysis has led me to develop my skills in data management, from ER diagrams to DBMS. I also enjoy learning about computer networking and object-oriented programming. When it comes to analyzing and conveying insights from datasets, I'm your guy. I use tools like Microsoft Excel, PowerBI, Tableau public version, and Looker Studio to visualize data and improve my analytics and storytelling skills.

If you had to describe me in three words, it would be detail-oriented, problem-solving, and entrepreneurial mindset. I'm always looking for ways to blend these attributes with my passion for programming and analysis. My goal is to save time and be more productive, which is why I'm constantly learning new tools and techniques for complex data through college and MOOC.

In addition to my data skills, I've gained solid experience in office tools like Microsoft Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint. I love working in a team setting and thrive in a culture of growth and collaboration. Whether it's working from home or in an office, I'm up for the challenge.

I'm currently seeking co-op opportunities to work with data collection, cleaning, and management. But I'm also open to more challenging opportunities in analysis, visualization, and presentation so I can get to know the entire process of being a data specialist. So, if you're looking for a data-loving, law-grad-turned-programmer, I'm your guy!
